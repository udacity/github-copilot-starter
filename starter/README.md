## Project Instructions

Use GitHub Copilot to refactor the code for this game to use React, NextJS, and ES6+ features. The goal is to create a more modern and maintainable codebase and add additional functionality to the final product. You can use any combination of code completion and chat features, like Ask, Edit, or Agent modes.

- Game should use React and NextJS for the frontend.
- Use ES6+ features such as arrow functions, destructuring, try/catch blocks, and modules.
- Error should be handled gracefully with appropriate messages to the user.
- Implement a Sudoku board generator that creates a valid Sudoku puzzle with a unique solution.
- Add a timer to track how long it takes to solve the puzzle.
- Implement a solution checker that verifies if the user's solution is correct using event delegation.
- Add a difficulty selector to allow users to choose between easy, medium, and hard puzzles.
- Implement a New Game button to start a new game without refreshing the page.
- Add a hint feature that provides clues for the user that are noted with unique colors.
- Add a check puzzle button that checks the current state of the board against the solution.
- User should get immediate feedback on their input, such as highlighting invalid entries.
- Top 10 scores should be saved in local storage and displayed on the page with the user's name, time taken, hints used, and difficulty level.
- use either modular CSS or a framework like Tailwind CSS for styling.
- The game should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- UI colors should be visually appealing and accessible.
- Completed and correct puzzles should display a congratulatory message with the time taken and hints used and ask for the user's name for Top 10 times.
